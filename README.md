AndroidAppWithRobolectricUnitTestsInAS101
=========================================

Android app project with Robolectric unit tests that runs inside Android Studio 1.0.1 IDE.

The motivation behind this project is explained in my blog entry "[Unit testing Android app using Robolectric and Android Studio 1.0.1](http://fumiakiy.tumblr.com/post/105374934877/unit-testing-android-app-using-robolectric-and)".

The goal of this project was to get successful unit testing like this screenshot.

You can see what was going on when I was trying to use Robolectric to write unit tests of the default Android Studio project by following commit logs of the master branch from the start. You should be able to find how to fix an error you may be seeing in the commit right after the "fail" commit that has the error in its commit message.

Hope this helps someone in the future who tries to do the same stuff.
